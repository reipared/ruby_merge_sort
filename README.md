# Merge Sort Algorithm

The "Merge Sort Algorithm" is a popular sorting algorithm implemented in the given Ruby function. This algorithm efficiently sorts an array by recursively dividing it into smaller halves, sorting them individually, and then merging them back together.

The function takes an array as input and applies the merge sort algorithm to sort the elements. It utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach by splitting the array in half and recursively sorting the left and right halves. The base case is when the array has a length of 1, in which case it is already considered sorted and returned as is.

The array is divided by finding the midpoint and creating left and right halves. The merge_sort function is called recursively on the left and right halves, sorting them separately. The sorted left and right halves are then merged back together by comparing the elements from each half and placing them in the merged array in the correct order.

The merging process continues until one of the halves becomes empty. The remaining elements from the non-empty half are then appended to the end of the merged array.

Finally, the function returns the merged array, which represents the sorted version of the input array.

The "Merge Sort Algorithm" provides an efficient and reliable method for sorting arrays of any size. It offers a stable sorting approach and performs well in various scenarios, making it a popular choice for sorting tasks.
